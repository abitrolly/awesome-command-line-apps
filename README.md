# Awesome Command Line Apps

Due to personal changes, GitHub changes, a desire of not wanting to continue to 
deal with mostly very low-effort contributions and not least a substantially 
lacking willingness to donate — despite hundreds of daily visitors and 25k+ 
stars — I've permanently moved this project to my personal Git instance, where 
it will live from now on:

Still available, still free, you can still contribute and are encouraged to by 
sending a `git am` style patch via email.
